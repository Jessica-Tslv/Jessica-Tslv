## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m a Development Support Engineer with a background in Operations and Customer Contact Analysis, having successfully pivoted into a technical role after dedicating my free time to learning and skill-building.

In my current role, I work closely with development teams to triage technical issues, using Jira and SQL to analyze live data, diagnose problems, and, where possible, implement real-time fixes on the live website.

## 🔍 Current Focus

* 🐍 Expanding my knowledge of Python, Linux, and Bash scripting

* ☁️ Gaining hands-on experience with cloud technologies (AWS & GCP)

* 🎓 Working towards an official cloud certification

* ⚙️ Building personal projects to apply new concepts in real-world scenarios
